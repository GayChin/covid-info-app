                    hospitalizations, and death.

                <div>
                    If you have symptoms of COVID-19, get tested. Donâ€™t delay: Treatment must be started early to be
                    effective. Self-tests are one of several options for testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 and
                    may be more convenient than laboratory-based tests and point-of-care tests.
