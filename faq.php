                Yes. Covid-19 vaccination and booster dose are recommended for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding or
                trying to get pregnant. By getting a vaccination, it can help to protect you from getting very sick from
                Covid-19 but it will not prevent you from being diagnosed with Covid-19. There is currently no evidence
                that Covid-19 vaccines have caused fertility problems in men or women.

            <div class="accordion_content">
                Some people who have fully recovered from Covid-19 experience a variety of mid- and long-term effects
                usually within three months from the onset of Covid-19. The symptoms are similar to the Covid-19
                symptoms which include fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, depression and many more that will
                affect a personâ€™s ability to perform daily activities. These symptoms might persist from their initial
                illness or develop after their recovery. They can come and go or relapse over time.

            </label>
            <div class="accordion_content">
                COVID-19 and influenza (flu) are both infectious respiratory diseases, and they share some similar
                symptoms. However, they are caused by different viruses. Both COVID-19 and influenza spread in similar
                ways through droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, sneezes or breathes.However, the
                vaccinations for Covid-19 and Influenza are different. Vaccines developed for COVID-19 do not protect
                against influenza, and similarly, the flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19.

            <div class="accordion_content">
                We should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities as it will compromise your
                breathing. However, we have to maintain at least 1-meter distance from others and limit the number of
                friends playing together.
                Children aged 5 years and under are not required to wear a mask, for children between 6 and 11 years of
                age, the use of masks depends on several factors which include availability of appropriate adult
                supervision and intensity of transmission in the area, whereas adolescents aged 12 years or older should
                follow the national mask guidelines for adults.
